Introduction: 

For this project, I am scraping all golf statistical data from the PGA tour dating all the way back to 2007. The reason for choosing the 2007 year as my start date is because that is the year the Fedex point system, awards golfers based on their perfromance through PGA Tour events through the season, was first established. My strong interest and passion for golf drives the motivation for this project. I desire to increase my knowledge for my own personal and career benefit. Working a career in the military and hopefully business, lots of deals and networking is done on the golf course. 

My goal from this project is to scrape the golf data from ESPN, capturing important stats including, season earnings, rounds played, cuts made, total number of wins, driving distance, average round score, greens in regulation, putts, etc. and run linear regressions, as well as, Random Forests models in order to help predict the total earnings of a player in that given season and the total number of tournament wins they will have. 




Scraping: 
I am scraping 15 seasons of the PGA Tour statistics from ESPN. Each season contains a split table layout, the left table contains player name and rank, while the other table contains all of the stat columns. These stats include total earnings, FedEx cup points, number of events played, number of rounds played, number of cuts made, top 10 finishes, total number of wins for that season, scoring average per round, driving distance (yards), driving accuracy, greens in regulation, putts per hole, save percentage, and birdies per round. I looped through each year, request the page, parse the tables seperately, and combine them row by row into one row per player per season. Some years were not able to be captured, unfortunately because they were not in HTML.

Clean Data

```{python}
cols_to_convert = ['rank', 'EVNTS', 'RNDS', 'CUTS', 'TOP10', 'WINS', 'SCORE',
                   'DDIS', 'DACC', 'GIR', 'PUTTS', 'SAND', 'BIRDS', 'CUP']

for col in cols_to_convert:
    if col in df_out.columns:
        df_out[col] = pd.to_numeric(df_out[col].astype(str).str.replace(',', ''), errors='coerce')
```



Visualization

Before I begin modeling, I want to understand the shape of the data visually. I explore several different types of visualizations highlighting the average earnings, average score, top 10 players, top players with most wins, and relationships between driving accuracy and driving distance. These visualizations help me gain a better understanding for the data. 





This visual shows how much the PGA Tour prize money has grown signifcantly over the past 20 years. This line shows how average player earnings increased approximately over 2 million within this timeline, showing how much the game has grown. 

```{python}
#Visual 1: Average Earnings by Season 
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df_out['EARNINGS'] = df_out['EARNINGS'].astype(str).str.replace('[$,]', '', regex=True)
df_out['EARNINGS'] = pd.to_numeric(df_out['EARNINGS'], errors='coerce')

earnings_by_season = df_out.groupby('season')['EARNINGS'].mean().reset_index()

sns.lineplot(data=earnings_by_season, x='season', y='EARNINGS')
plt.title('Average Player Earnings by Season')
plt.xlabel('Season')
plt.ylabel('Average Earnings ($)')
plt.show()
```



This plot line shows whether the tour has gotten more or less competitive. It seems like over the years, players have gotten better in terms of scoring. The average scoring average across all PGA Tour players was relatively stable between 2007 and 2016, fluctuating between roughly 71.2 and 71.6 strokes per round with no clear directional trend. Starting around 2017 there is a clear and sustained decline, dropping from 71.4 down to 70.2 by 2024, nearly a full stroke lower per round across the entire field in just seven years. This is well documented in professional golf and is driven by better equipment, launch monitor technology, and players approaching the game more like elite athletes. For the modeling section this trend is worth noting, a scoring average of 71.0 in 2010 represents a different level of performance relative to the field than a 71.0 in 2023.



```{python}
#Visual 2: Average Score over Time

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df_clean = df_out[df_out['SCORE'] > 0].copy()

score_by_season = df_clean.groupby('season')['SCORE'].mean().reset_index()

sns.lineplot(data=score_by_season, x='season', y='SCORE')
plt.title('Average Player Score by Season')
plt.xlabel('Season')
plt.ylabel('Average Score')
plt.show()
```





For this visual, I want to see the overall top players within this time period. Being a golf fan, I already know the big names. However, this graph just validates my knowledge and shows just how dominant Tiger Woods has been the past 20 years. If this data went back even further, it would add to the narrative that Tiger is even more dominant than this graph shows. 


```{python}
#Visual 3: Top 10 Players by Career Wins

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

career_wins = df_out.groupby('player')['WINS'].sum().reset_index()
career_wins = career_wins.sort_values('WINS', ascending=False).head(10).reset_index(drop=True)


sns.barplot(data=career_wins, x='WINS', y='player')
plt.title('Top 10 Players by Career Wins (2007-2024)')
plt.xlabel('Total Wins')
plt.ylabel('Player')
plt.show()
```




This correlation heatmap highlights the importance the statistics that are being evaluated are correlated with each other. For example, driving distance, driving accuracy, greens in regulation, number of putts, and save percentages correspond to each other. They all go hand in hand with each other, ultimately affecting one another. As a golfer, this all makes sense, the less times you hit the fairway on a drive, will most likely lead to hitting an approach shot on the green, which will most likely lead to being farther away from the hole when you putt. 

It is also important to point out that number of rounds and cuts made have a strong correlation with all of the individual player statistics. The better one player plays, the more likely they are to play more rounds and make more number of cuts. 


```{python}
#Visual 4: Correlation Heatmap

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


numeric_cols = ['EARNINGS', 'EVNTS', 'RNDS', 'CUTS', 'TOP10', 'WINS',
                'SCORE', 'DDIS', 'DACC', 'GIR', 'PUTTS', 'SAND', 'BIRDS']

numeric_cols = [col for col in numeric_cols if col in df_out.columns]

corr_matrix = df_out[numeric_cols].corr()

sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, cmap='coolwarm', center=0)
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap of PGA Tour Stats')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```



This scatterplot shows the relationship between greens in regulation percentage and average score. The negative trend is clear, players who hit more greens in regulation consistently shoot lower scores. This makes intuitive sense because hitting a green in regulation gives a player two putts to make par, meaning more GIR opportunities directly translates to more birdie chances and fewer bogeys. The cluster is densest between 63% and 72% GIR, which represents the typical range for a full-time PGA Tour player. The few outliers on the lower left with low GIR and low scores are likely players with exceptional short games who compensate for missing greens by getting up and down consistently.

```{python}
#Visual 5: GIR vs Average Score

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df_gir = df_out[(df_out['GIR'] > 50) & (df_out['SCORE'] > 50)].copy()


sns.scatterplot(data=df_gir, x='GIR', y='SCORE', alpha=0.4)
plt.title('Greens in Regulation vs Average Score')
plt.xlabel('Greens in Regulation (%)')
plt.ylabel('Average Score')
plt.show()
```


This scatterplot confirms one of the most well known tradeoffs in professional golf, the longer a player hits the ball, the less accurate they tend to be off the tee. The negative relationship is clear across the full range of the data, with players averaging 260-270 yards typically hitting 65-75% of fairways, while players averaging 310-325 yards drop closer to 50-55% accuracy. This tradeoff exists because hitting the ball harder and further requires a more aggressive swing that is harder to control. In recent years players like Bryson DeChambeau have pushed the distance extreme further, accepting lower accuracy in exchange for shorter approach shots into greens.

```{python}
#Visual 6: Driving Accuracy vs Driving Distance

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df_drive = df_out[(df_out['DDIS'] > 200) & (df_out['DACC'] > 10)].copy()

sns.scatterplot(data=df_drive, x='DDIS', y='DACC', alpha=0.4)
plt.title('Driving Distance vs Driving Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Average Driving Distance (yards)')
plt.ylabel('Driving Accuracy (%)')
plt.show()

```




I create two rate-based features, cuts made rate and top 10 rate, which normalize performance relative to how many events a player entered. A player who made 15 cuts in 20 events is more impressive than one who made 15 cuts in 30 events, and these rates capture that. I also apply a log transformation to earnings because of the right skew we saw in the distribution. Log transforming a skewed target variable helps models perform better. 


```{python}
df_copy = df_out.copy()

df_copy['cuts_made_rate'] = df_copy['CUTS'] / df_copy['EVNTS']
df_copy['top10_rate']     = df_copy['TOP10'] / df_copy['EVNTS']
df_copy['log_earnings']   = np.log1p(df_copy['EARNINGS'])


df_copy
```


Linear Regression Model

This linear regression model for predicting season earnings produced a r-squared value around 0.66-0.68. This means that the 12 variables explains on average 66-68% of the variation in player earnings. The strongest predictor by far was the percentage that the player finished in the top 10 of tournaments they played in. Putts per round was the most negative predictor, reflecting that the worse a player is at putting, the stronger it is associated with lower earnings. Overall, the regression results were not conclusive enough, suggesting that a model like Random Forest will produce better results. 


```{python}
#Linear Regression for Earnings 

import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

lr_earnings = smf.ols(
    formula='EARNINGS ~ EVNTS + RNDS + CUP + cuts_made_rate + top10_rate + SCORE + DDIS + DACC + GIR + PUTTS + SAND + BIRDS',
    data=df_copy
).fit()

lr_earnings.summary()
```




This linear regression model for predicting season wins produced a r-squared value of around 0.26-0.28. This means that the 12 variables explains on average 26-28% of the variation in players wins. The strongest predictor by far was the amount of FedEx cup points a player has. This is very intuitive, proving that the more times one wins,it correlates to more FedEx points. Overall, the regression results were worse than the linear regression for prediciting a players earnings. This supports my decision to pivot to another model, one that captures non-linear relationships. 




```{python}
#Linear Regression for Wins

import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

lr_wins = smf.ols(
    formula='WINS ~ EVNTS + RNDS + CUP + cuts_made_rate  + top10_rate + SCORE + DDIS + DACC + GIR + PUTTS + SAND + BIRDS',
    data=df_copy
).fit()

lr_wins.summary()
```






Random Forests



In order to run a Random Forests model, a time-based train/test split is used, training on seasons prior to 2023 and testing on 2023 and 2024. 

```{python}
#Preparing Data
df_model = df_copy.copy()
df_model = df_model.dropna(subset=['EVNTS', 'RNDS', 'CUP', 'cuts_made_rate', 'top10_rate','SCORE', 'DDIS', 'DACC', 'GIR', 'PUTTS','SAND', 'BIRDS', 'EARNINGS', 'WINS']).copy()
df_model['season'] = df_model['season'].astype(int)

#Time based split
train_df = df_model[df_model['season'] < 2020].copy()
test_df  = df_model[df_model['season'] >= 2020].copy()

FEATURES = ['EVNTS', 'RNDS', 'CUP', 'cuts_made_rate', 'top10_rate',
            'SCORE', 'DDIS', 'DACC', 'GIR', 'PUTTS', 'SAND', 'BIRDS']

X_train = train_df[FEATURES].values  
X_test  = test_df[FEATURES].values   

#Earnings targets
y_train_earn = train_df['EARNINGS'].values  
y_test_earn  = test_df['EARNINGS'].values   

#Wins targets
y_train_wins = train_df['WINS'].values  
y_test_wins  = test_df['WINS'].values   

```


Random Forests

The earnings model produces a r-squared of around 0.69 with an MAE of approximately $610K. This Random Forest model explains approximately 69% of the variation of earnings within the data. Compared to the linear regression baseline, the Random Forest model performed similarly. Even though it is not a significant increase, I trust the results of this model more due to the ability to capture the non-linear relationships and it overall higher complexity. 


```{python}
#Random Forest Earnings
#%pip install --upgrade scikit-learn
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score


#Fit Random Forest model
rf_earn = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=300, 
                                 random_state=42)   
rf_earn.fit(X_train, y_train_earn) 

#Predict and evaluate
y_pred_rf_earn = rf_earn.predict(X_test) 

mae_rf_earn  = mean_absolute_error(y_test_earn, y_pred_rf_earn)
r2_rf_earn   = r2_score(y_test_earn, y_pred_rf_earn) 


print(mae_rf_earn)
print(r2_rf_earn)



```


This Random Forests model that predicts the number of wins achieved a r-squared value of around 0.3, which means it explains approximately 30% of variation of number of wins. This model produces an increase in r-squared value, suggesting that the Random Forest model better captures the nonlinear relationship between variables in the data. 


```{python}
#Random Forests Wins
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score


#Fit Random Forest model
rf_wins = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=300,  
                                 random_state=42)   
rf_wins.fit(X_train, y_train_wins) 

#Predict and evaluate
y_pred_rf_wins = rf_wins.predict(X_test)

mae_rf_wins  = mean_absolute_error(y_test_wins, y_pred_rf_wins)
r2_rf_wins   = r2_score(y_test_wins, y_pred_rf_wins) 


print(mae_rf_wins)
print(r2_rf_wins)

```



Feature Importance 


The feature importance results from the Random Forest earnings model highlight the top 10 rate as the most influential predictor by far. These results align closely with the results produced by the linear regression results. At second, was the number of FedEx cup points. This can be validated because the more Fedex points a player accumulates, most likely correlates to a more successful season, which will ultimately lead to more money earned. Rounds played was the third most influential predictor, showing that the more number of rounds played will lead to more earnings.


```{python}
#Extract feature importance Earnings
importance_earn = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature':    FEATURES,                     
    'importance': rf_earn.feature_importances_  
}).sort_values('importance', ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)


sns.barplot(data=importance_earn, x='importance', y='feature') 
plt.title('Random Forest Feature Importance - Earnings')     
plt.xlabel('Importance')                                      
plt.ylabel('Feature')                                         
plt.show()                                              

```


The feature importance results from the Random Forest wins model reinforce the Random Forest earnings model above with the top 10 rate as the dominant predictor. The second predictor is FedEx cup points, reflecting that the points system rewards consistent high finishes which are closely aligned to winning. Unlike the earnings model, the wins model spreads importance more evenly across ball-striking stats, like birdies, driving distance, driving accuracy, etc. 


```{python}
#Extract feature importance Wins
importance_wins = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature':    FEATURES,                    
    'importance': rf_wins.feature_importances_  
}).sort_values('importance', ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)


sns.barplot(data=importance_wins, x='importance', y='feature') 
plt.title('Random Forest Feature Importance - Wins')  
plt.xlabel('Importance')                             
plt.ylabel('Feature')                                       
plt.show()  

```


Prediction


The Random Forest model projects that Scottie Scheffler will lead the tour with total earnings and total amount of wins in the 2026 season. This is consistent based on the results of the 2024-2025 season. The rest of the top 10 seems to pass the eye test, as all the golfers have the capability and potential to lead the tour in wins and total earnings this year. 


```{python}


df_2025 = df_copy[df_copy['season'] == 2024].copy()
df_2025['cuts_made_rate'] = df_2025['CUTS'] / df_2025['EVNTS']
df_2025['top10_rate'] = df_2025['TOP10'] / df_2025['EVNTS']


df_2026 = df_2025[FEATURES + ['player']].dropna().reset_index(drop=True)

# Generate predictions using Random Forest
df_2026['predicted_earnings_2026'] = rf_earn.predict(df_2026[FEATURES].values)
df_2026['predicted_wins_2026'] = rf_wins.predict(df_2026[FEATURES].values)

df_2026_out = (df_2026[['player', 'predicted_earnings_2026', 'predicted_wins_2026']].sort_values('predicted_earnings_2026', ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True))

print(df_2026_out.head(10))

```



Conclusion: 

The goal of this project is to use data science to better understand what seperates the best players on the PGA Tour from everyone else. By using different methods, linear regression and Random Forests, I built these models to predict two key outcomes for the PGA Tour. These outcomes consisted of season earnings and tournament wins, two big categories that every golfer strive to be at the top of. 


Golf is more than just a sport. It is a "language" that is broken into many different aspects of the world, whether that is business, military, and most important entertainment. The world of golf has dramatically evolved over the past handful of years, mostly due to COVID-19. Many people had the chance the fall in love with the game and it has steadily become more popular since then. As someone that loves the game and is someone pursuing a career in both military and potentially business, I understand firsthand that some of the most important relationships and deals happen on a golf course. That personal connection is what motivated this project.
